*Naive Bayes CA Assingment*

Control: this is the control class which will instantiate the the GUI

Naive_Bayes : This is the core class for the program and will be utilizing arraylists and hashmaps to go 
through the file source and calculate the probabilities of the contraction of the coronavirus

GUI : This class has the graphical user interface elements and t will display to the user the program

Case : This class is used for sorting the variables of the symptoms. The class has two methods, toString, 
and the getters and setters for all of the variables


//Summary of the application

The application presents the user with a gui which is very straight forward and has no comand line involved. the user is  
to check the radio buttons on the screen for the different symptomps of which most of them are are yes or no. 
These are then stored by the Case class. The application uses the Naive Bayes algorithim which calculates the probability 
of each of the variables and then calculates the overall probality for that symptom.
